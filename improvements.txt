Did you use puntenshawl to find any of the title puns?

look up the trie data structure

dictionary with phonemes as the keys
also reversed direction phonemes
aka back to front and front to back
thus with a trie (???) structure it could return anything that starts with the right set of phonemes.
(also maybe convert them to strings because why the hell not? string comparison is fast, right?)
HUZZAH.

Find puns on a subject by looping through all the words on a subject
